<div class="about">
  <p>The City of Kansas City, MO Cultural Asset Mapping initiative (a.k.a. Creative City Spaces) will support the
    creation of an online map of city-owned cultural assets and creative spaces in Kansas City. The City’s first
    comprehensive cultural asset map will provide residents and tourists with access to the city’s rich arts, culture
    and heritage within diverse neighborhoods. Assets include memorials and historical monuments, the City’s public art
    collection, museums, cultural centers, historic monuments and over 100 fountains across the city. The map/inventory
    will also list time-based events such as the City-sponsored events (i.e. festivals, bike/walk rides, homes tours,
    etc.) through the Neighborhood Tourist Development Fund. The second phase of the project will also identify, map and
    promote city-owned spaces such uses as rehearsals, community conversations, exhibitions and performances by artists
    and organizations. The final phase of the project will be to invest in commissions to activate underutilized city
    spaces located in zip codes with the lowest life expectancy. Project goals are to: 1) highlight the connections
    between arts and social impact in neighborhoods; 2) provide affordable work spaces for artists and organizations;
    and 3) increase arts use of publicly-owned property throughout the city.</p>
